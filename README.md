  ### 2. How to solve problems
  
  Techniques and steps to split a problem and deliver a solution.
   
  **Problem**
  > Given your birthday and the current date, calculate your age in days. Compensate for leap days. Assume that the birthday and current date are correct days (and             no time travel). Simply put, if you were born 1 Jan 2012 and todays date is 2 Jan 2012 you are 1 day old.

### 3. Efficiency

When we refer to the efficiency of a program, we aren't just thinking about its speed—we're considering both the **time**
it will take to run the program, and the amount of **space** the program will require in the computer's memory.
Often there will be a trade-off between the two, where you can design a program that runs faster by selecting a
data structure that takes up more space—or vice versa.
